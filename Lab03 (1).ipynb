    "The concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) are complex and should be broken down for people new to programming. After consulting ChatGPT, I have learned a lot about OOP, such as the difference between a class and a type. A class gives initial values attributes and assigns behaviors by way of methods. The type function outputs the type or class of an object. For example, some common types are strings, integers, and floats, whereas the user usually defines classes. Objects and instances are also quite closely related. Objects focus more on the variable itself and are an instance in a class, and each instance has its own assigned behaviors (methods) and initial values. For example, if we create a class name Car and we say car1=Car(\"Mustang\",1990) and car2=Car(\"Ford\", 1967), car1 and car2 are both instances of the class. I have briefly touched upon attributes, but more formally, attributes are the initial values that affect a variable. In a class named Car(), if we write car1.color, color is the attribute. A variable is essentially a name assigned to a value. If we say x=10, x is the variable, and 10 is the value. Pure functions are nice, as they are predictable and easy to track and debug, but they do not change state, which is the main benefit of modifiers. Modifiers allow for changes in outside variables, which are often utilized in the real world, such as altering data from a database."
